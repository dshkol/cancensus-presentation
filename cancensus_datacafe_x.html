## Why Cancensus?

The current Statistics Canada dissemination model wasn't quite cutting it for some people. 

Programmatic API access to Census data has been promised for a long time but we got tired of waiting...


...so we built it ourselves. 

---
## Under the hood

*cancensus* is an open-source library that anyone can install for their R client. It's not yet on CRAN* but you can install the development version from Github.


```r
devtools::install_github("mountainmath/cancensus")
```

*cancensus* is an API to Statistics Canada Census data cloned and rehosted via [censusmapper.ca](https://censusmapper.ca). While use of this package requires an API key to manage bandwidth and usage, anyone can register for a free key on censusmapper.ca. 

Once you have downloaded *cancensus* and received your API key, just set your environment up the first time you use it by running:


```r
Sys.setenv(CM_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY")
```
.footnote[[*] Soon. The truth is we got distracted making things with cancensus instead of finishing it.]
---
## A *cancensus* query in detail


```r
example &lt;- get_census(dataset, level, regions, 
                      vectors, geo_format, labels, 
                      use_cache)
```
- `dataset`: select Census 2006, 2011, or 2016 data
- `level`: Geographic aggregation level (C, P, CD, CSD, CT, DA)
- `regions`: Census region for your data
- `vectors`: Census variable vectors
- `geo_format`: data only, or data + spatial in `sp` or `sf` formats
- `labels`: Detailed vector var names or truncated names
- `use_cache`: option to store hashed data locally to reuse offline

---
## *cancensus* provides tools to simplify working with the Census


```r
# List all Census variables
list_census_vectors(dataset)

# Search for Census variables containing specific terms 
search_census_vectors(searchterm, dataset)

# Search for parent and children nodes in Census variables
parent_census_vectors(vector)
child_census_vectors(vector)

# Provide detailed variable description for Census variable vectors
label_vectors(df)
```

---
## *cancensus* provides tools to simplify working with the Census


```r
# List all Census regions
list_census_regions(dataset)

# Search for Census regions containing specific terms 
search_census_regions(searchterm, dataset, level)

# Query for Census geography only without any data
get_census_geometry(dataset, level, geo_format)
```

## Calculating Language Diversity

The Language Diversity Index is calculated as 1 minus the probability any two random people in a population speak the same language. 

Greenberg (1958) provides a simple formula that we can use:
$$ 
LDI = 1 - \Sigma (P_i)^2
$$





Let's use this to find out what are the most diverse parts of Metro Vancouver.

### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

```r
library(cancensus)

# Select Census dataset
dataset &lt;- "CA16"

# search through Census variables to find the parent vector
language_total &lt;- search_census_vectors("Language spoken most often", 
                                        dataset) %&gt;% 
  filter(vector == "v_CA16_1355") 

# Select all leaf nodes of this vector. 
# The parameter TRUE returns only the finite leaves 
# among child nodes. 

language_children &lt;- language_total %&gt;%
  child_census_vectors(TRUE) 
# We'll need the aggregated total for our calculations 
# so let's append them together

language_vectors &lt;- bind_rows(language_total, 
                              language_children) %&gt;%
  pull(vector)
```
There are 218 language stems. 
---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

```r
# Search for Census regions at the CMA level 
# with Vancouver in the name
van_region &lt;- search_census_regions("vancouver", 
                                    dataset, 
                                    level = "CMA") %&gt;%
  as_census_region_list 
```

---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

Finally we can query our Census data combined with spatial data (in `sf` format*)

```r
library(sf)

langs_van &lt;- get_census(dataset, level = "CSD", 
                        regions = van_region , 
                        vectors = language_vectors, 
                        geo_format = "sf", labels = "short",
                        quiet = TRUE)
```

.footnote[[*] cancensus can retrieve spatial data in either `sf` or `sp` format. The latter is a well developed and stable spatial library, while the former is bleeding-edge, often with bugs. Despite that `sf` is the future spatial standard for R and has a number of advantages.] 
---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

We run the function* to calculate the Language Diversity Index on our Census data.


```r
van_ldi &lt;- ldi_calc(langs_van)
```

.footnote[[*] The code to calculate the Language Diversity Index score for each geographic area is a bit verbose. You can find it detailed [here](https://www.dshkol.com/2017/language-diversity-in-canada/) along with a detailed description of some of the issues with language data if you are so inclined.]

---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

Visualizing our data is very easy because our data is already in a nice and tidy format. 


```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(van_ldi, aes(x = `Region Name`, y = ldi)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Language Diversity for Greater Vancouver CSDs",
       x = NULL, y = "Language Diversity Index")
```

---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

We can easily compare population against language diversity.


```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(van_ldi %&gt;% filter(ldi &gt; 0) , aes(y = Population, x = ldi)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Language Diversity vs Population Size",
       y = "Population Size", x = "Language Diversity Index",
       caption = "2016 Census data, 
       Some CSDs with very low populations excluded.")
```

---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

Finally, because our data is already spatial, making maps is super easy. 


```r
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

ggplot(van_ldi) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ldi), colour = NA) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c("Language Diversity Index", option = "magma") + 
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Language Diversity Greater Vancouver CSDs",
       x = NULL, y = NULL,
       caption = "2016 Census data, 
       some CSDs with very low populations excluded.")
```

---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

What if we used CT-level data instead? Easy. 

Just go back to the original cancensus query and swap the aggregation level. You already have the code for everything else. 


```r
langs_van &lt;- get_census(dataset, level = "CT", 
                        regions = van_region , 
                        vectors = language_vectors, 
                        geo_format = "sf", labels = "short",
                        quiet = TRUE)
```
All you have to do now is rerun `van_ldi &lt;- ldi_calc(langs_van)` on the new data and you're ready to go.

---
### Calculating Language Diversity: Hands-on

DA-level map? Sure, why not*.


```r
langs_van &lt;- get_census(dataset, level = "DA", 
                        regions = van_region , 
                        vectors = language_vectors, 
                        geo_format = "sf", labels = "short",
                        quiet = TRUE)
```

.footnote[[*] Actually you may want to watch out with DA level data as it can take a fair bit of time to query, download, process, and map - and may burn through your API quota.]
